MapReduce-BSP-Adapter
=====================

Simple implementation of Map-Reduce over Apache Hama BSP framework. For key ideas please refer to http://javahadoopalgorithms.blogspot.in/2013/01/map-reduce-over-bulk-synchronous.html

### QUICKSTART
If you have written a map-reduce job you'll find the api very similar.
You can find a sample WordCount example here. https://github.com/dapurv5/MapReduce-BSP-Adapter/blob/master/src/main/java/org/apache/hama/mapreduce/examples/WordCount.java
